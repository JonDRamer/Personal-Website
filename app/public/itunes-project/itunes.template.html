    <p class="projectText">Guess that song is the first web "app" I ever made.  I was about three weeks into my journey of learning to code when I made this app. I learned how to use both jQuery and AJAX the same week that I made this game. I found an online template to add some styling. Every project has a quirk and the quirk here is that it doesn't work very well!  Actually it works perfectly as long as you type the title of the song perfectly!  You can cheat by opening up the console in your browser and you will find a convenient log with the title of the current song that is playing. It's a very simple game, but it holds some centimental value because at the time I thought it was pretty amazing!</p>
