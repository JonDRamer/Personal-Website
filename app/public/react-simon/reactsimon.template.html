    <p class="projectText">For my Q3 project at galvanize I was encouraged to use a foreign technology in my project. I decided that I wanted to teach myself React Native. I had never used React Native before, but it was on my list of things to learn. I made this app in week 17 of the progam at galvanize. It's a simple app, but I learned a lot about React in the process of making it. It runs on both IOS and Android.  I hope to add some features and get this on both app stores soon.</p>
